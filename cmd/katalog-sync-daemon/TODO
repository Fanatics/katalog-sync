TODO:
- make "check" mode configurable
- default annotation values as config on daemonset
    -- sync interval


annotations TO add:
    - sidecar required (don't update state unless told by sidecar)
        -- maybe as a "mode" flag?
    - check sync interval
    - 


?
    - can we "watch" API changes from kubelet?
        -- not today, so we'll have to poll and do the updates ourselves
    -
